# SnowPlow Arduino Tracker

## Overview

An event tracker for IP-connected [Arduino] [arduino] boards, the SnowPlow Arduino Tracker is our first event tracker for the [Internet of Things] [iot].

With this tracker you can collect sensor- and eventstream data from your Arduino-based projects and send it back to your [SnowPlow] [snowplow] collector. Some project ideas:

* Track the movement of products around your shop/warehouse/factory using Arduino, [RFID readers] [arduino-rfid] and SnowPlow
* Deploy a set of SnowPlow-connected Arduinos to monitor the environment (temperature, humidity, light levels etc) in your warehouse/factory/workplace/shop/museum
* Send vehicle fleet information (locations, speeds, fuel levels etc) back to SnowPlow using Arduino's [3G and GPS] [3g-gps] shields
